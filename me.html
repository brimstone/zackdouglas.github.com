        <p>Writing code is easy. Writing <u>good</u> code is <em>hard</em>.
           So how do you figure out which is which? &quot;Perfect practice makes perfect.&quot;
        <p>The web is the first place to learn from the best and brightest,
           and abiding by the mantra that &quot;I know enough to know that I know nothing&quot;,
           I hope someone else learns enough to understand the same.
