# Learning
This is just a little post to tell you about a little script that took too long to write to do too little. But, it's here, and that's what counts.

Writing for the sake of writing is worth something, even if that something is only to keep the stream of thoughts in your head from pooling up and drowning you!

## Relearning
So, this is where it starts: Talking about a BASH script that could have been written in '94, rediscovered in '04, and was rewritten tonight. But, _why_? Because learning is hands-on. That's what GitHub's about: Pushing hands-on to the forefront for as many people as possible. That's also why I love Markdown: It's the simplest way I know to create a document that is accessible in the most ways possible. It's just a shame that it took me so long to accept my Markdown overlord.

And, to that end, the same can be said for BASH. There's just so much power baked into Bash that I've left yet undiscovered! Well, you have to start somewhere, so I started this blog, complete with a script for posting new entries with minimal effort. I'll be eating my own dogfood, so hopefully this repo will be well maintained in the future!
